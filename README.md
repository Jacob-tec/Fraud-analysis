📥 Downloading the Data

The dataset used in this project is Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle.
Since the dataset is too large to host on GitHub, you need to download it manually:

    Create a free Kaggle account.

    Go to the dataset page: Fraud Detection Dataset.

    Click Download and extract the contents.

    Place the file fraudTest.csv into:

    data/raw/

🧹 Cleaning the Data

    Open the notebooks/data_cleaning.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

    Run all cells — this will:

        Remove duplicates and null values

        Format columns (dates, transaction amounts)

        Save the cleaned dataset as:

        data/cleansed/FraudTest_clean.csv

    This cleaned file will be used by the dashboard.
